In this thesis, I present how a realtime audio synthesizer---with web UI and Open Sound Control interface---is implemented in a modern systems programming language, namely Rust. Because of the inherent parallelism in many of the audio algorithms, i.e. FFT, and fast execution times to reduce latency, Rust with its aim to be a \enquote{safe, concurrent and practical language} is the weapon of choice.

The Introduction gives a overview about signal processing basics and explains the types and parts of a synthesizer in general. Furthermore there will be an explanation of the Open-Sound-Control protocol.

Discrete-Time Filters and DFFT will be described in this chapter.
\ldots

In clonclusion, the thesis argues that Rust is a good choice for time-critical applications \ldots

% The aim of this thesis is to investigate and identify the present status of abstract writing in English for bachelor’s and master’s theses at the UAS Wildau, and to make recommendations for students who are required to produce abstracts in English.

% In the first part, results of a short empirical survey of the university faculties and degree programs are presented.
% These show that there is growing demand for student abstracts in English, but at present students receive very little guidance in this matter.

% The thesis then identifies the uses of an English abstract, and further outlines the structure of an abstract. In a detailed central section the thesis provides studentswith useful practical tips on the language of abstracts, including rules for creating headings and titles, and giving lists of phrases and vocabulary that are commonly used in abstracts.
% Here, the thesis draws on a number of sources from other universities and books on academic writing in English.

% In conclusion, the thesis argues that abstract writing in English is essential but that students should not be expected to be able to write good abstracts without assistance.
% This thesis hopes to offer all UAS Wildau students useful tips on writing abstracts in English, and thus make a small contribution to improving the general standard of bachelor’s and master’s theses.
