    abstract = {The structure of the Open Sound Control (OSC)
content format is introduced with historical context.
The needs for temporal synchronization and
dynamic range of audio control data are described
in terms of accuracy, precision, bit-depth, bit-rate,
and sampling frequency. Specific details are given
for the case of instrumental gesture control, spatial
audio control and synthesis algorithm control.
The consideration of various transport mechanisms
used with OSC is discussed for datagram, serial
and isochronous modes. A summary of design
approaches for describing audio control data is
shown, and the case is argued that multi-layered
information-rich representations that support multiple
strategies for describing semantic structure are
necessary.},
