content format is introduced with historical context.
The needs for temporal synchronization and
dynamic range of audio control data are described
in terms of accuracy, precision, bit-depth, bit-rate,
and sampling frequency. Specific details are given
for the case of instrumental gesture control, spatial
audio control and synthesis algorithm control.
The consideration of various transport mechanisms
used with OSC is discussed for datagram, serial
and isochronous modes. A summary of design
approaches for describing audio control data is
shown, and the case is argued that multi-layered
information-rich representations that support multiple
strategies for describing semantic structure are
necessary.},

abstract = {'Mathematics can be as effortless as humming a tune, if you know the tune' writes Gareth Loy. In Musimathics, Loy teaches us the tune, providing a friendly and spirited tour of the mathematics of music--a commonsense, self-contained introduction for the nonspecialist reader. It is designed for musicians who find their art increasingly mediated by technology, and for anyone who is interested in the intersection of art and science.In this volume, Loy presents the materials of music (notes, intervals, and scales); the physical properties of music (frequency, amplitude, duration, and timbre); the perception of music and sound (how we hear); and music composition. Musimathics is carefully structured so that new topics depend strictly on topics already presented, carrying the reader progressively from basic subjects to more advanced ones. Cross-references point to related topics and an extensive glossary defines commonly used terms. The book explains the mathematics and physics of music for the reader whose mathematics may not have gone beyond the early undergraduate level. Calling himself 'a composer seduced into mathematics,' Loy provides answers to foundational questions about the mathematics of music accessibly yet rigorously. The topics are all subjects that contemporary composers, musicians, and musical engineers have found to be important. The examples given are all practical problems in music and audio. The level of scholarship and the pedagogical approach also make Musimathics ideal for classroom use. Additional material can be found at a companion web site.},

As the amount of processed data is constantly increasing, there is considerable request for fast manipulation with huge data. Moreover, there is demand for fast algorithms which can exploit computational power of modern parallel architectures. The aim of this chapter is to review the algorithms and approaches for computation of convolution with regards to various properties such as signal and kernel size or kernel separability (when pro-cessing n-dimensional signals). Target architectures include superscalar and parallel processing units (namely CPU, DSP, and GPU), programmable architectures (e.g. FPGA), and distributed systems (such as grids).

@article{Wishnick:TVF,
abstract = {A variety of methods are available for implementing time-varying digital filters for musical applications. The considerations for mu- sical applications differ from those of other applications, such as speech coding. This domain requires realtime parametric control of a filter such as an equalizer, allowing parameters to vary each sample, e.g. by user interaction, a low-frequency oscillator (LFO), or an envelope. It is desirable to find a filter structure that is time- varying stable, artifact-free, computationally efficient, easily sup- ports arbitrary filter shapes, and yields sensible intermediate filter shapes when interpolating coefficients. It is proposed to use the state variable filter (SVF) for this purpose. A novel proof of its stable time-varying behavior is presented. Equations are derived for matching common equalizer filter shapes, as well as any z- domain transfer function, making the SVF suitable for efficiently implementing any recursive filter. The SVF is compared to state of the art filter structures in an objective evaluation and a subjective listening test. The results confirm that the SVF has good audio quality, while supporting the aforementioned advantageous quali- ties in a time-varying digital filter for music. They also show that a class of time-varying filter techniques useful for speech coding are unsuitable for musical applications.},

@phdthesis{Pekonen2013,
abstract = {This thesis deals with virtual analog synthesis, i.e., the digital modeling of subtractive synthesis principle used in analog synthesizers. In subtractive synthesis, a spectrally rich oscillator signal is modified with a time-varying filter. However, the trivial implementation of the oscillator waveforms typically used in this synthesis method suffers from disturbing aliasing distortion. Filter-based algorithms that produce these waveforms with reduced aliasing are studied in this thesis. An efficient antialiasing oscillator technique expresses the waveform as a bandlimited impulse train or a sum of time-shifted bandlimited step functions. This thesis proposes new polynomial bandlimited function generators and introduces optimized look-up table and polynomial-based functions for these algorithms. A new technique for generating nonlinear-phase bandlimited functions is also presented. In addition to the aforementioned technique, the research focus in oscillator algorithms is on ad-hoc approaches that either post-process the output of the trivial oscillator algorithm or produce signals that look similar to the classical waveforms. Linear post-processing algorithms that suppress aliasing of the waveform generated, in principle, by any oscillator algorithm are introduced in this thesis. Perceptual aspects of the audibility of aliasing are also addressed in this thesis. The results of a listening test that studied the audibility of aliasing distortion in a trivially sampled sawtooth signal are shown. Based on the test results, design criteria for digital oscillator algorithms are obtained and the usability of previously used computational measures for the evaluation of aliasing audibility is analyzed. In addition, modeling of analog synthesizer oscillator outputs is addressed in this thesis. Two separate models for the sawtooth signal generated by the oscillator circuitry of the MiniMoog Voyager analog synthesizer are developed. The first model uses phase distortion to generate sawtooth waveforms that resemble that of the MiniMoog. The second model filters the output of a digital oscillator algorithm with a fundamental frequency dependent post-processing filter. The techniques described in this thesis can be used in the development of alias-free oscillator algorithms for virtual analog synthesis. Also, the output of this oscillator can be processed to sound and look like the respective waveform of any analog synthesizer using the methods proposed here.},

@phdthesis{Otalvar2015,
abstract = {The issue of reducing or completely eliminating the aliasing caused by the discontinuities found in trivial pitched oscillators used in Virtual Analog (VA) synthesis has brought a lot of research. Standard methods, commonly referred as Ideally Bandlimited, such as: additive synthesis, Discrete Summation Formulae (DSF), and Feedback Delay Loop (FDL), are very expensive computationally. In order to have a implementation that is real time ecient, other algorithms have been developed that use less computational resources but allow some aliasing, spe- cially at high frequencies. The cost of reducing the aliasing is seen at the harmonic envelope, losing amplitude mainly at higher frequencies near the Nyquist limit. Such methods are categorized as Quasi-Bandlimited Algorithms and include: the Bandlimited Impulse Trains (BLIT) and the Bandlimited Step Functions (BLEP), the latter being the focus of study in this document. Most recent methods allow aliasing in the complete audible band, but it is suppressed in comparison to the trivial methods. These are referred as Alias-Suppressing methods and include: the Di erentiated Parabolic Waveform (DPW) and the Polynomial Transition Regions (PTR). These last two categories take advantage of the human hearing threshold and the e ect of frequency masking to hide the aliasing from the human ear. It has been established that even though the BLEP method is more expensive computationally than the other methods available, due to its look up table imple- mentation, it has the best performance in terms of sound quality. The purpose of this research is to nd, using a genetic algorithm that has a perceptual model as feedback, an optimal input for the BLEP method based on the sinc function and its applied window (Hanning, Hamming, Blackman, Blackman-Harris, Welch, etc.). The goals are: rst, to eliminate the most aliasing overall while keeping a fairly good harmonic envelope. And second, to optimize the size of the table and the number of BLEP points of correction.},

Next, the design of the structures of the applicable techniques are presented in detail, and properties and design issues of these structures are discussed. A major implemen- tation problem is raised in digital source-filter synthesis, where the use of classic wave- forms, such as sawtooth wave, as the source signal is challenging due to aliasing caused by waveform discontinuities. Methods for existing bandlimited waveform synthesis are reviewed, and a new approach using polynomial bandlimited step function is pre- sented in detail with design rules for the applicable polynomials. The approach is also tested with two different third-order polynomials. They reduce aliasing more at high frequencies, but at low frequencies their performance is worse than with the first-order polynomial. In addition, some commonly used sound effect algorithms are reviewed with respect to their applicability in computationally efficient music synthesis. In many cases the sound synthesis system must be capable of producing music con- sisting of various different sounds ranging from real acoustic instruments to electronic instruments and sounds from nature. Therefore, the music synthesis system requires careful sound design. In this thesis, sound design rules for imitation of various sounds using the computationally efficient synthesis techniques are presented. In addition, the effects of the parameter variation for the design of sound variants are presented.},

abstract = {Virtual analog synthesis refers to computational methods that imitate the sound production principles used in electronic music synthesizers of the 1960s and 1970s. In practice, it means digital subtractive synthesis. In this paper, we introduce new methods to generate digital versions of classical analog waveforms with reduced aliasing. We also propose modifications to the digital nonlinear model of the Moog ladder filter. These virtual analog synthesis techniques enable the production of retro sounds with modern computers.

Techniquesdescribed include summation of bandlim- ited primitive waveforms as well as table-lookup techniques. Bandlimited pulse and triangle waveforms are obtained by integrating the difference of two out-of-phase bandlimited impulse trains. Bandlimited impulse trains are generated as a superposition of windowed sinc functions. Methods for more general bandlimitedwaveformsynthesis are also reviewed. Methods are evaluated fromthe perspectives of sound quality, computational economy, and ease of control.},

abstract = {“Hard sync”, a form of oscillator synchronization, is a tech- nique which synthesizes a characteristic rich family of sounds. We describe how to perform it by integrating a bandlimited impulse pattern, avoiding the unpleasant aliasing heard in a naive digital rendering. The synthesis is refined by using a minimum-phase bandlimited step function, which eliminates lookahead and integration. This idea also gives simple band- limited syntheses of other discontinuous waveforms.},

@article{Nam2009,
abstract = {The rich spectra of classic waveforms (sawtooth, square and tri- angular) are obtained by discontinuities in the waveforms or their derivatives. At the same time, the discontinuities lead to aliasing when the waveforms are digitally generated. To remove or re- duce the aliasing, researchers have proposed various methods, mostly based on limiting bandwidth or smoothing the wave- forms. This paper introduces a new approach to generate the vir- tual analog oscillators with no aliasing. The approach relies on generating an impulse train using a feedback delay loop, often used for the physical modeling of musical instruments. Classic waveforms are then derived from the impulse train with a leaky integrator. Although the output generated by this method is not exactly periodic, it perceptually sounds harmonic. While addi- tional processing is required for time-varying pitch shifting, re- sulting in some high-frequency attenuation when the pitch chan- ges, the proposed method is computationally more efficient than other algorithms and the high-frequency attenuation can be also adjusted.},
