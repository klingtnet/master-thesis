    abstract = {The structure of the Open Sound Control (OSC)
content format is introduced with historical context.
The needs for temporal synchronization and
dynamic range of audio control data are described
in terms of accuracy, precision, bit-depth, bit-rate,
and sampling frequency. Specific details are given
for the case of instrumental gesture control, spatial
audio control and synthesis algorithm control.
The consideration of various transport mechanisms
used with OSC is discussed for datagram, serial
and isochronous modes. A summary of design
approaches for describing audio control data is
shown, and the case is argued that multi-layered
information-rich representations that support multiple
strategies for describing semantic structure are
necessary.},

Benson provides a wealth of information here to enable the teacher, the student, or the interested amateur to understand, at varying levels of technicality, the real interplay between these two ancient disciplines. The story is long as well as broad and involves physics, biology, psycho acoustics, the history of science, and digital technology as well as, of course, mathematics and music. Starting with the structure of the human ear and its relationship with Fourier analysis, the story proceeds via the mathematics of musical instruments to the ideas of consonance and dissonance, and then to scales and temperaments. This is a must-have book if you want to know about the music of the spheres or digital music and many things in between.},

@misc{LoyMusimathics2,
    abstract = {'Mathematics can be as effortless as humming a tune, if you know the tune' writes Gareth Loy. In Musimathics, Loy teaches us the tune, providing a friendly and spirited tour of the mathematics of music--a commonsense, self-contained introduction for the nonspecialist reader. It is designed for musicians who find their art increasingly mediated by technology, and for anyone who is interested in the intersection of art and science.In this volume, Loy presents the materials of music (notes, intervals, and scales); the physical properties of music (frequency, amplitude, duration, and timbre); the perception of music and sound (how we hear); and music composition. Musimathics is carefully structured so that new topics depend strictly on topics already presented, carrying the reader progressively from basic subjects to more advanced ones. Cross-references point to related topics and an extensive glossary defines commonly used terms. The book explains the mathematics and physics of music for the reader whose mathematics may not have gone beyond the early undergraduate level. Calling himself 'a composer seduced into mathematics,' Loy provides answers to foundational questions about the mathematics of music accessibly yet rigorously. The topics are all subjects that contemporary composers, musicians, and musical engineers have found to be important. The examples given are all practical problems in music and audio. The level of scholarship and the pedagogical approach also make Musimathics ideal for classroom use. Additional material can be found at a companion web site.},

It is em-ployed in filtering, denoising, edge detection, correlation, compression, deconvolution, simulation, and in many other applications. Although the concept of convolution is not new, the efficient computation of convolution is still an open topic. As the amount of processed data is constantly increasing, there is considerable request for fast manipulation with huge data. Moreover, there is demand for fast algorithms which can exploit computational power of modern parallel architectures. The aim of this chapter is to review the algorithms and approaches for computation of convolution with regards to various properties such as signal and kernel size or kernel separability (when pro-cessing n-dimensional signals). Target architectures include superscalar and parallel processing units (namely CPU, DSP, and GPU), programmable architectures (e.g. FPGA), and distributed systems (such as grids). The structure of the chapter is designed to cover various applications with respect to the signal size, from small to large scales.},
