\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my appreciation to the following people for their their help and support:

\begin{itemize}
\item My supervisor Prof.~Dr.~Mario Hlawitschka for his DSP lecture which originally sparked my interest in this topic, his advice and patience when the finishing of this thesis was delayed.
\item My family, especially my parents and sister, for their unconditional support during this research and the rest of my academic career. Without your help, I may have given up.
\item Lucas, Ren√©, Marcus E., Mario L., Katharina, Florian, Carolin, Tobias S. and Tobias J. (in no particular order) for many fruitful discussions, giving me feedback and sometimes another perspective on the topic.
%\item My proof reader \ldots
\end{itemize}

In addition, I would like to thank \href{https://www.spreadshirt.net/}{spreadshirt} for giving me the flexibility in my working schedule that was needed to finish this thesis.
Moreover, finishing this thesis would not have been possible without spreadshirt's financial support.
